# Various_Erlang
Mostly code retyped from books and courses, with some minor changes when seen fit (like adding types and documentation since usually no one bothers to...).

## [Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP](https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do) [WIP]
Wonderful book on advanced elements of Erlang.

## [Erlang In Practice](https://pragprog.com/screencast/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice)
A screencast that sadly is quite outdated, still usable though and is a nice way to get a feel for how things work in Erlang.

## [Kent Erlang Master Class](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/ErlangMasterClasses)
Interesting three part course. Tbh it is a bit of a mess, especially the conversations at the end of each section... Worth the watch though as it is taught by both Joe Armstrong and Francesco Cesarini.

## [Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!](https://learnyousomeerlang.com) [WIP]
The one and only true source of Erlang knowledge.

## [Stuff Goes Bad: Erlang In Anger](https://www.erlang-in-anger.com) [WIP]
Covers various tools and such; written by the author of LYSEfGG. I don't have anything to say about it yet... ;>
